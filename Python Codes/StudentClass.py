# Create a class vector with 3 data members x,y,z and overload + operator to
# get addition and - operator to get subtraction. You can also overload *
# operator to find scalar product(dot product) and ** operator to find vector
# product(cross product)
# Example - v1 = Vector(1,2,3)
# print(v1) ->          i + 2j + 3k
# v2 = Vector(2,3,4) -> 2i + 3j + 4k
# v1+v2 = 3i + 5j + 7k
# v1-v2 = -i - j - k
# v1*v2 = (1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4) = 2+6+12 = 20
# v1**v2 = cross product
